# Purpose: Generation of interactions of neutrinos from BNB and cosmic rays.

#
# This job configuration generates events with the same neutrino configuration 
# as `prodcorsika_genie_standard_icarus.fcl`, but with a different cosmic
# ray model (proton rays only).
# 
# Output
# -------
# 
# See `prodcorsika_genie_standard_icarus.fcl`.
# The main output is an _art_ ROOT file with content:
#  * `generator`: neutrino interaction(s) from GENIE
#                 (with flux, GENIE truth and beam gate information)
#  * `cosmgen`:   generated cosmic rays from CORSIKA
